# Instructions

This project contains code to analyze legislator votes and generate CSV reports. It has been developed using Python 3+ and has no external dependencies.

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3+: If you don't have Python 3 or a later version installed on your system, you can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download or clone this project repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the code: Execute the following command to run the main.py file:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

This will execute the main script and generate the required CSV reports.

5. Check the output: Once the code execution is complete, you will find the generated CSV files in the same directory. The filenames will be 'legislators-support-oppose-count.csv' and 'bills-support-oppose-count.csv'.

That's it! You have successfully run the code and generated the CSV reports. You can check the module implementations in the challenge_package.

Feel free to modify the code or customize it according to your specific requirements. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please let me know.
